                <li>
                  <h3>Viewing data</h3>
                  <p>When you enter the GFW interactive map, UMD/Google tree cover loss and gain data layers are displayed by default. Using the tabs across the top of the map, you can view the range of available data, categorized by type, and find more information for each by clicking the “?” icon. Simply select a data layer to turn it on or off in the map. You can view currently displayed data layers in the summary window on the left-hand side of the page. For data layers restricted to a particular geographic region (e.g., FORMA alerts), this window also provides the option to turn on the “Geographic coverage.” This feature allows you to view the geographic extent of the particular data layer on the map.</p>

                  <p><strong>Try it out!</strong> Under the “FOREST CHANGE” tab, select “FORMA alerts.” In the data window, turn on the geographic coverage. Now overlay the alerts with protected areas, which can be turned on in the “CONSERVATION” tab.</p>

                  <p>A timeline can be found on the bottom of the map when a “FOREST CHANGE” layer is turned on, referred to as the “time slider.” The time slider allows you to view data over time and/or within a defined time interval. By default, each layer displays data from the entire study period (i.e., not restricted to a time interval). Some data layers (e.g., UMD/Google tree cover loss) allow you to view change over time by selecting the “play” icon on the time slider. For these layers, you can also drag the square ends of the time slider to view data for a defined time period. You can define the time interval displayed in other data layers by clicking on your desired timeframe.</p>

                  <p><strong>Try it out!</strong> With UMD/Google tree cover loss turned on (the default data layer), press the “play” icon located on the time slider at the bottom of the map. Now try viewing data only since 2004 (hint: drag the handles of the time slider).</p>

                  <p>Some data layers are more interactive on the map; you can click on individual shapes to see additional information. This feature applies to “NASA active fires,” and to data within “FOREST USE,” “CONSERVATION,” and “PEOPLE” tabs. Within some of these layers, you can also analyze data found under the “FOREST CHANGE” by individual data layer shapes. See below for more information.</p>

                  <h3>Analyzing data</h3>
                  <p>The GFW interactive map enables basic analysis of data found under the “FOREST CHANGE” tab. There are two ways by which you can analyze these data layers on the map:</p>
                  <ul class='bullets'>
                    <li><strong>Hand drawn area.</strong> Once you have turned on a “FOREST CHANGE” layer you wish to analyze, select the “analysis” icon (which resembles a chart) located at the top of the map. You are now in draw mode and can create a polygon using your mouse. Connect the dots to make a shape, and then scroll to the bottom of the map and select “DONE” to analyze the area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Land concessions and protected areas.</strong> You can also analyze data layers under the “OREST CHANGE” tab by theboundaries of land-use concessions (e.g., logging concessions) and protected areas. To do so, turn on “FOREST CHANGE” layer you wish to analyze, and then activate the concession layer (concession are located under “FOREST USE”) or protected area layer, depending on what analysis you would like to conduct. Next, identify and select the particular hape of interest, which might be a specific lgging concession, oil palm plantation, or protected area. Once selected, a window will appear that contains the “analysis” icon in the top right corner. Click the icon to perform the analysis.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>When your area of interest is analyzed, a window displaying the results will appear on the right-hand side of the map. Depending on the type of data under “FOREST CHANGE” that you are analyzing, different information will appear, such as hectares of tree cover loss, number of alerts, or number of active fires. The window also indicates the time interval of the analysis, which can be adjusted using the time slider. As you adjust the time interval, the analysis results will update. The window also features a link to download the full data set. Once you are finished with the analysis, press the “trash” icon to discard it.</p>
                  <p>The near real-time FORMA alerts have an additional feature available through analysis: subscription. With this feature, you can subscribe to alerts for an area of interest and receive an email when a new tree clearing has been detected, on a monthly-basis. Once you have analyzed an area for the number of FORMA alerts, navigate to the “mail” icon in the analysis window (located next to the “trash” icon). Select the icon and enter your email address to subscribe to alerts. Please note: FORMA alerts are only available for the humid tropical forest biome (turn on “Geographic coverage” for more detail).</p>

                  <p><strong>Try it out!</strong> Navigate to the “FOREST CHANGE” tab and turn on the FORMA alerts data layer. Next, click the analysis icon located at the top of the map and draw a shape within the humid tropical forest biome (Not sure where that is? Turn on the “Geographic coverage” feature, located in the window on the left-hand side of the map). Once you have drawn a shape, click “DONE” to view the results.</p>
                  <p>Additional analysis functionality is available in other areas of the website. To analyze FOREST CHANGE data layers by country or subnational boundaries, please visit COUNTRY PROFILES AND RANKINGS. For more comprehensive analysis related to commodities or fires, please visit GFW Commodities or GFW Fires.</p>

                  <h3>Sharing map views</h3>
                  <p>Maps can tell powerful stories. Through GFW, we make it possible to share compelling visuals and analyses for news articles, blog posts, and other outside sources. There are two options to share your current view (and analysis results, if applicable):</p>
                  <ul class='bullets'>
                  <li>Select the “share” icon located at the top of the map (near the “search” box). Next, choose whether you would like to share the map view by embedding HTML (ideal for websites) or by URL.</li>
                  <li>Simply copy and paste the URL from your browser, which will always take you to your current map view.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Adjusting map settings</h3>
                  <p>The interactive map offers simple settings to meet user needs.</p>
                  <p>By default, data is displayed on a basic black and white map which includes political boundaries, major geological features, and other key areas of interest. To change the base map, navigate to the “map” icon at the top of the map (near the “search” box). Once selected, you will see the range of base maps available, including those comprised of satellite imagery. Click “?” to find out more about each base map.</p>
                  <p>For two of GFW’s key data sets, UMD/Google tree cover extent and loss, we provide a setting that allows users to adjust the canopy density of tree cover data displayed on the map. You can adjust the canopy density depending on the national standards or ecosystem type in your area of interest. To access this feature (ONLY available for UMD/Google tree cover extent and loss) select the “settings” icon at the top of the map (near the “search” box). Using the slider at the bottom of the window, you can select to view data (and perform analysis) at canopy densities: >10%, >15%, >20%, >25%, >30%, >50%, and >75%.  The default tree cover canopy density is >30%. The canopy density selected will appear in the data window on the left-hand side of the map, and within the analysis window if you perform an analysis. If you select a canopy density other than the default, the “settings” icon will be highlighted green. For more information, click the “?” icon.</p>
                  <p><strong>Try it out!</strong> Enter the interactive map and turn off the UMD/Google tree cover gain layer. The map should now only show UMD/Google tree cover loss. Select the “settings” icon and adjust the canopy density to >70%. Notice how the data changes, especially in drier parts of the world.</p>

                  <h3>Why do forests matter?</h3>
                  <p>Human society and the global economy are inextricably linked to forests. More than 1 billion people depend on forests for their livelihoods. Forest ecosystems also play a critical role in stabilizing the climate; providing food, water, wood products, and vital medicines; and supporting much of the world’s biodiversity.</p>

                  <p>Despite recent efforts to combat harmful deforestation in some regions, forest ecosystems are still under threat. According to <a href='http://www.wri.org/our-work/project/forest-and-landscape-restoration' target='_blank'>WRI research</a>, 30% of potential global forest cover has been cleared, while another 20% has been degraded. Most remaining forests have been fragmented, leaving only about 15% of original forest cover intact.</p>

                  <p>Balancing the demand for natural resources with the need to preserve vital ecosystems requires robust data to help resource managers make good decisions. GFW can help by providing this information at a global scale.</p>

<h3>How does GFW define key terms?</h3>
<p><strong>Forest</strong></p>
                  <p>Various definitions exist for the term “forest,” and GFW does not aim to provide a consensus definition. Data sets hosted on GFW may define “forest” differently or pertain to different types of forest (primary, secondary, tree plantations, etc.). Through information found on the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>, we aim to be transparent about the assumptions and definitions feeding into each data set.</p>
                  <p>In our general writing, including the GFW blog, “forest” refers to a landscape with a high density of trees and value for biodiversity, carbon storage, and human use.</p>

                  <p><strong>Deforestation</strong></p>
                  <p>How one defines “deforestation” is dependent on how one defines “forest.” As noted above, various definitions of forest exist and GFW does not aim to provide a consensus view. Correspondingly, GFW does not provide a single definition for “deforestation.”</p>
                  <p>In general writing, GFW uses “deforestation” to refer to the removal of a significant number of trees from a landscape, typically in the context of human actions rather than natural events such as fires or disease. We generally refer to “gross” deforestation (the total amount of forest loss), rather than “net deforestation” (the total amount of forest loss minus the amount of forest gain), or clearly specify otherwise.</p>
                  <p>For more information on each data set, please visit our <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %></p>

                  <p><strong>Tree cover</strong></p>                  
                  <p>Where found on the GFW website, “tree cover” refers to the biophysical presence of trees, which may be part of natural forests or tree plantations. The inclusion of all types of tree plantations in the “tree cover” definition notably distinguishes the term from some definitions of “forest.” Accordingly, “tree cover” and “forest” should not be used interchangeably. Different data sets further define “tree cover” with added parameters (see the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %> for details and distinctions).</p>
                 
                  <p><strong>Tree cover loss</strong></p>
                  <p>“Tree cover loss” refers to the removal of trees, which may be within natural forests or tree plantations. Accordingly, “tree cover loss” does not necessarily equate to “deforestation” and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. Different data sets have additional parameters that must be met for the indication or alert of loss to appear on the GFW map (see examples below).</p>
                  
                  <ul class='bullets'>
                    <li><strong>UMD/Google tree cover loss:</strong> Loss is defined as “stand replacement disturbance,” or the complete removal or mortality of tree cover canopy (of any canopy cover density) at the Landsat pixel scale (30x30 meters).</li>

                    <li><strong>FORMA alerts:</strong> Loss alerts are triggered by areas exhibiting a steep, persistent drop in vegetation intensity, indicating a high probability (equal to or greater than 50%) of the occurrence of tree cover loss. It is important to note that this alert-based system is not the same as an area measurement of tree cover loss.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Does GFW distinguish tree plantations from natural forests?</h3>

                  <p>Tree plantations are not distinguished from natural forests in the case of several key data sets hosted on GFW (including 2000 tree cover extent, UMD/Google tree cover loss and gain, FORMA alerts, and QUICC alerts). Tree cover loss may include cases of tree plantations being harvested, and tree cover gain may include cases where natural forests are replaced with tree plantations.</p>

                  <p>It is nonetheless important to <a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/805.full' target='_blank'>distinguish</a> between natural forests and tree plantations when considering conservation, carbon storage, and value to local communities. Natural forests have higher biodiversity, store more carbon, and are more often associated with the traditional livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. Accordingly, GFW and partners are developing a “plantation forests map” for the tropical regions to determine the location of plantations on a near-global scale. The map, developed through remote sensing methods, will be coming soon to GFW.</p>

                  <h3>Do GFW data reveal the quality of forest management (e.g., sustainable versus unsustainable)? What about forest change from natural versus human causes?</h3>

                  <p>The forest change data displayed on GFW (such as UMD/Google tree cover loss and FORMA alerts) do not necessarily distinguish the quality of the forest management (e.g., sustainable or unsustainable), the legality (illegal or legal), or the cause (e.g., natural or human) of forest change events. For example, the forest change data available on GFW will include forest change from tree harvesting, fires, pests, and forest clearing for agriculture.</p>

                  <p>However, contextual data available on GFW can help users draw more informed conclusions about the nature and drivers of forest change events. For example, users can overlay forest change data over the protected areas layer to flag areas of potential concern. Or users can pull up satellite imagery base maps to look for “burnscars,” “blowdowns,” logging roads, and so on.</p>

<h3>What kinds of data are available on Global Forest Watch?</h3>
                  <p>GFW seeks to bring together the most current, reliable, and robust data to monitor forest change around the world. GFW incorporates and integrates a wide range of data sets that can be overlaid and compared, including:</p>

                  <ul clasS='bullets'>
                    <li><strong>Forest change data</strong>, such as global tree cover loss and gain data from the University of Maryland/Google, near real-time FORMA alerts for the humid tropics, SAD alerts for the Brazilian Amazon from Imazon, quarterly vegetation change data from NASA, and others</li>
                    <li><strong>Forest cover data</strong>, including global tree cover extent data, intact forest landscapes, and pantropical carbon density</li>
                    <li><strong>Forest fire data</strong>, from NASA’s Modis satellite (see <a href='http://www.fires.globalforestwatch.org' target='_blank'>GFW Fires</a>)</li>
                    <li><strong>Forest use data</strong>, which includes contextual information, such as concession areas for natural resource extraction or agricultural production</li>
                    <li><strong>Conservation data</strong>, such as global boundaries for protected areas and biodiversity hotspots</li>
                    <li><strong>Qualitative and anecdotal data</strong>, such as user-submitted stories (submit one <%= link_to 'here', new_story_path %>)</li>
                    <li><strong>People data</strong>, including community land boundaries and land tenure rights (coming soon)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>By monitoring changes tracked by these data sets over time, users can better understand drivers and patterns of forest loss worldwide.</p>

                  <h3>Where do the data come from?</h3>
                  <p>The data on GFW come from various sources. Most of the data are in the public domain and have been developed by governments, NGOs, research institutions, or companies. Note that the data come in different formats and vary in their accuracy, timeliness, and geographical extent. See GFW’s <%= link_to 'Data policy', "#{sources_path}#data_policy" %> for more details.</p>

                  <p>Some data are produced directly by WRI and our partners, such as FORMA alerts, Intact Forest Landscapes, and some forest use data.</p>

                  <h3>Do you have these data sets available for every country?</h3>
                  <p>GFW aims to provide data with global coverage, but this isn’t always possible. The geographic coverage of each data set is described on the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>.</p>

                  <p>Data may have limited coverage for various reasons. GFW works to incorporate new data as quickly as possible as they are made available. If you know of a publicly available data set that we do not have, please <a href='mailto:gfw@wri.com'>contact us</a> to let us know.</p>

                  <h3>How accurate are the data displayed on Global Forest Watch?</h3>
                  <p>The accuracy of the data displayed on GFW is variable. Methodologies and cautions for specific data sets are available on the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>.</p>

                  <p>GFW strives to include only the most accurate data whenever possible and to make the user aware of the risk of inaccuracies in the data. GFW is not responsible for data from other sources. See more about GFW’s approach to data in our <%= link_to 'Data policy', "#{sources_path}#data_policy" %>.</p>

                <li>
                  <h3>Why do different data layers contradict each other or not overlap exactly?</h3>
                  <p>Different data sets measure different things and are derived using different methodologies. Such differences can lead to results that may manifest as contradictory layers on the GFW platform. In some cases, a lack of available high-quality data may cause a greater margin of error for certain data sets.</p>

                  <ul class='bullets'>
                    <li><p><strong>Intact Forest Landscapes vs. tree cover extent:</strong> These data sets measure different things. Tree cover extent shows all 30 x 30 meter areas that meet a minimum threshold of tree cover (25% canopy cover), whereas Intact Forest Landscapes only show forests that show no significant signs of human activity (see the <%= link_to 'Data page', "#{sources_path}#forest_cover" %> for specifics).</p>

                    <p>Users may find instances where tree cover extent does not fall within the boundaries of intact forest landscapes. This is because the Intact Forest Landscapes layer is based on MODIS (250 meter resolution satellite imagery), which is known to overestimate low tree cover densities, whereas the tree cover extent layer is based on Landsat (30 meter resolution satellite imagery). As a result, the tree cover extent layer may not show tree cover in an area that is covered by an intact forest landscape polygon.</p></li>
