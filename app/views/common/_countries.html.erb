      <strong>Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)</strong>
      <p>The Convention on Biological Diversity was launched on 29 December 1993. Its three main objectives are to conserve biological diversity, sustainably use the components of biological diversity, and fairly and equitably share the benefits resulting from the use of genetic resources.</p>
      <p>Terms:</p>
      <p>All terms—“ratification,” “accession,” “approval,” and “acceptance”—signify a state’s consent to be bound by a treaty. The legal incidents and implications of ratification, accession, approval, and acceptance are the same. The treaty becomes legally binding on the state or the regional economic integration organization. Countries that have not ratified the treaty are identified as “Non Parties.”</p>
      <p><u>Ratification and Accession</u></p>
      <p>Ratification and accession have the same legal effect. The main distinction concerns when a state accepts the offer or the opportunity to become a party to a treaty. Only states that have signed a treaty, while it was open for signature, can proceed to ratify it. The signature does not establish consent to be bound, hence the need for ratification. Accession is the act whereby a state becomes a party to a treaty that has already been negotiated and signed by other states.</p>
      <p><u>Acceptance and Approval</u></p>
      <p>The terms “acceptance” and “approval” originated more recently and apply under the same conditions as those for ratification. The legal effect is the same as ratification. The use of one term or the other results from differences in legal systems. Certain countries, especially some East European states, use the terms “acceptance” or “approval” for participation in treaties. The terms are also used when organizations (e.g., the EU) rather than states become parties to an international treaty.</p>
      <p><u>Succession</u></p>
      <p>Succession occurs when one state replaces another in the responsibility for the international relations of a territory. Generally, a newly independent state that issues a notification of succession is considered a party to a treaty from the date of the succession of states or from the date of entry into force of the treaty, whichever is later.</p>

      <p>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was negotiated at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992 and entered into force on 21 March 1993. The treaty’s main goal is the “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”</p>
      <p>Terms:</p>
      <p>The convention divides countries into three main groups based on their commitments.</p>
      <p><u>Annex 1 Parties</u></p>
      <p>Industrialized countries that were members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1992 and countries with economies in transition (EIT Parties), such as the Russian Federation, the Baltic states, and several Central and Eastern European states.</p>
      <p><u>Annex II Parties</u></p>
      <p>OECD members of Annex I but not the EIT Parties. Annex II Parties are required to provide financial resources to enable developing countries to undertake emissions reduction activities under the convention and to help them adapt to effects of climate change.</p>
      <p><u>Non–Annex I Parties </u></p>
      <p>Mostly developing countries that are recognized by the convention as being particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and/or the potential economic impacts of climate change response measures.</p>
