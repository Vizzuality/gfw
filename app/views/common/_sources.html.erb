              <h3>Summary</h3>
              <p>The FORMA alerts dataset uses a computer algorithm to analyze satellite imagery and identify new areas of forest clearing in near-real-time across the world’s humid tropical forest biome. The system analyzes freely available satellite imagery, recorded daily by the <a href="http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/" target="_blank">MODIS</a> sensor, which operates on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellite platforms. The FORMA alerts system then detects pronounced changes in vegetation cover over time, as measured by an indicator known as the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php" target="_blank">NDVI</a>. These pronounced changes in vegetation cover are often indicative of forest being cleared, burned, or replaced by pastures, croplands, or plantations.</p>

              <p>This algorithm produces alerts that indicate where forest clearing is statistically likely to have occurred within a 500 x 500 meter area.</p>

              <p>Upcoming upgrades to FORMA include improving the resolution to 250 meters x 250 meters, and expanding coverage to the rest of the tropics and eventually to other forest ecoregions.</p>

            <div class="source_description">
              <h3>Methodology</h3>
              <p>This dataset uses freely available satellite imagery, collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (<a href="http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/" target="_blank">MODIS</a>), which operates on NASAs Terra and Aqua (EOS PM) satellite platforms and views the entire Earth’s surface every 1 to 2 days. The images help to reveal notable changes in vegetation cover over time using an indicator that measures vegetation intensity called the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (<a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php" target="_blank">NDVI</a>). By applying an automated algorithm to this input and in combination with complementary data inputs for fire hotspots and global precipitation averages, areas where forest clearing is likely to have occurred are therefore identified. The algorithm also employs parallel processing in a remote server system the cloud that enables the rapid analysis of these very large data sets.</p>

              <h3>Explanation</h3>
              <p>Forest clearing alerts appear when and where new, large-scale clearing is likely to have occurred after 2005. Thus, the alerts should not be interpreted as an analysis of total forest cover loss area, but rather as an indication of an area that has a high probability of having experienced forest cover loss or disturbance over time. The system employs advanced statistical techniques to achieve the best fit to scientifically validate information on clearing, measured as a probability.  On the GFW website, alerts appear only for 50 percent or higher probability. That is, alerts appear for a particular period when there has been significant clearing in the area during or before that period.</p>

              <h3>Temporal and spatial resolution</h3>
              <p>The forest clearing alerts are produced every 16 days, however they are presented on the GFW site as monthly alerts because the precipitation data input is only available on a monthly time cycle. Users can manipulate the GFW time slider to view trends in clearing alerts from December 2005 to present.</p>

              <p>The alert system currently identifies 500 x 500 meter areas where clearing is statistically likely to have occurred. Alerts for a 250-meter resolution version are currently being developed on Google’s Earth Engine platform and will be available in 2014.</p>

              <h3>Geographic extent</h3>
              <p>FORMA alerts are currently available only for humid tropical forests (as defined by <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/27/9439.full#ref-1" target="_blank">Hansen et al. (2008)</a>, based on <a href="http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf">WWF’s terrestrial ecoregions</a>) spanning portions of 89 countries. The development team is working to incorporate additional data to extend the geographic coverage beyond the current extent. Currently FORMA data spans across portions of 89 countries. To visualize the geographic extent of the alerts on the map, switch on the “Humid Tropical Forest Biome” layer.</p>

              <h3>Data applications</h3>
              <p>The forest clearing alerts have been designed for quick identification of forest clearing as it emerges. This allows for rapid response and prioritization of scarce financial and human resources dedicated to forest conservation or sustainable forest management. Armed with this information, stakeholders can use preemptive methods such as on-the-ground visits or aerial inspection with high-resolution satellite imagery (less than 5 meter pixel resolution) to investigate suspected forest clearing areas.</p>

              <p>In addition, the alerts may be of value to a variety of researchers who study both temporal and spatial patterns related to forest clearing areas.</p>

              <p>Using the GFW platform, the alerts can be compared against other relevant data layers, such as protected areas and concessions boundaries, to evaluate the effectiveness of forest management practices across time and spatial extent.</p>

              <h3>Accuracy and validation</h3>
              <p>Inaccuracies are an inherent part of remote sensing analysis. FORMA Alerts appear in areas with a greater than 50% probability of deforestation, based on the algorithm described under methodology. However, persistent cloud cover is a continuous issue in the tropics, and extreme flooding can also produce unreliable remotely-sensed data that will result in forest clearing “false positives.” Furthermore, the alerting system cannot detect all forest cover loss, whether due to the small size of clearings, persistent cloud cover, or other explanations still being identified through GFW validation efforts.</p>

              <p>The GFW team is working aggressively to address potential inaccuracies in the data through rigorous validation methods. Specifically, the GFW team is comparing the growing data set of historical alerts to other validated data sets, which are being used for similar applications.</p>

              <p>This paper demonstrates the spatial correlation of the alerts with the PRODES and DETER data sets, produced by the Brazilian Space Agency for the Amazon.  The conclusions from the paper help to illustrate the potential pitfalls of the algorithm, along with its strengths. Through future refinement and proposed crowdsourcing efforts, the GFW team expects the data quality of the FORMA Alerts will continue to improve.</p>

              <p>SAD or Sistema de Alerta de Desmatemento is a monthly deforestation alert system that monitors increments of forest degradation and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The information the systems generates is published monthly by Imazon, a Brazilian NGO, through the Forest Transparency bulletin. The monthly alerts are derived from a temporal mosaic of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) daily images that are scaled down from 500-meter to 250-meter. The monthly results are also validated using more detailed images from the China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite (CBERS) and NASA Landsat data.</p>

              <h3>Summary</h3>
              <p>The Tropical forest carbon stocks shows biomass carbon stocks for over 2.5 billion ha of forest on three continents and encompasses tropical forests for the early 2000s.  The total carbon stock is based on live biomass (above-and below-ground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical microwave and imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape.  The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted for 49%, 25%, and 26% of the total stock, respectively. By analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from ± 6% to ± 53%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national (>1,000,000 ha) scales at ca. ± 5% and ca. ± 1%, respectively. The benchmark map illustrates regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.</p>

              <h3>Summary</h3>
              <p>Logging in Cameroon’s forests is permitted within Forest Management Units (FMUs). This dataset displays the FMUs within Cameroon’s permanent forest estate. There are 114 FMUs in Cameroon which are further divided into logging concessions called annual allowable cuts (AACs), where selective logging is permitted. These logging permits require owners and operators to maintain permanent forest cover. This dataset, released in 2012, was produced in a collaboration between the Cameroon Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife and WRI.

              <p>This data layer shows the boundaries of agro-industrial zones, where oil palm and rubber tree plantations, as well as other crops, may be established. In Cameroon, industrial agriculture falls outside of the National Forest Estate. Agricultural plantations are allocated by the Ministry of Economy and Planning to private entitities under long-term, renewable contracts, which are then monitored by the Ministry of Agriculture. The agro-industrial dataset was mapped using satellite imagery, with ground-truthing to determine the crop type and operating company. Official documentation was often lacking, so boundaries should be considered approximate and are not exhaustive.</p>

              <h3>Overview:</h3>
              <p>The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global spatial data set on marine and terrestrial protected areas available. Protected area data are provided via <a href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/" target="_blank">protectedplanet.net</a>, the online interface for the <a href="http://www.wdpa.org/" target="_blank">World Database on Protected Areas</a> (WDPA). WDPA is a joint initiative of the IUCN and UNEP-WCMC to compile spatially referenced information about protected areas.</p>
              <h3>Note: <a href="http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/" target="_blank">IUCN Management Categories</a></h3>
              <p>Not all protected areas receive the same degree of protection. While some have strict guidelines designed to preserve intact ecosystems, others allow for sustainable land use, often including limited resource extraction. In addition, not all countries use the same terminology when designating a protected area. Accordingly, the  <a href="http://www.iucn.org/" target="_blank">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> defined universal management categories that stipulate the level of protection for most protected areas.</p> 
              <p>As you click through protected areas in this layer, note the “legal designation” and the explanations below to better understand the degree to which an area is protected.</p>  
              <p><b>Ia. Strict Nature Reserves.</b> Protected areas designed to preserve biodiversity and all geological features. Limited human use (e.g., scientific study, education) is allowed and carefully monitored. Strict Nature Reserves are often used to understand the impact of indirect human disturbance (e.g., burning fossil fuels) because of the area’s high level of preservation.</p>  
              <p><b><i>Other common designations:</b> Biological Reserve, Botanical Reserve</i></p>
              <p><b>Ib. Wilderness Areas.</b> Protected areas managed to preserve ecosystem processes with limited human use. Wilderness Areas cannot contain modern infrastructure (e.g., a visitor’s center), but they allow for local indigenous groups to maintain subsistence lifestyles. These areas are often established to restore disturbed environments.</p>  
              <p><b><i>Other common designations:</b> Wilderness Reserve, Wildlife Area</i></p>
              <p><b>II. National Parks.</b> Protected areas designed to preserve large-scale ecosystems and support human visitation. With conservation as a priority, these areas allow infrastructure and contribute to the local economy by providing opportunities for environmental educational and recreation.</p>  
              <p><b><i>Other common designations:</b> State Park, Class A Park, Park Reserve, Provincial Park</i></p>
              <p><b>III. National Monuments or Features.</b> Areas established to protect a specific natural feature (e.g., cave, grove) or human-made monument with significant historical, spiritual, or environmental importance and the immediate surroundings. Accordingly, Natural Monuments or Features are typically smaller in area and have high human impact resulting from visitor traffic.</p>  
              <p><b><i>Other common designations:</b> Natural Features Reserve, Nature Monument, Botanical Garden</i></p>
              <p><b>IV. Habitat and Species Management Areas.</b> Areas designed to conserve specific wildlife populations and/or habitats. Habitat and Species Management Areas often exist within a larger ecosystem or protected area and are carefully managed (e.g., through hunting abatement or habitat restoration) to conserve a target species or habitat.</p>  
              <p><b><i>Other common designations:</b> National Wildlife Refuge, State Wildlife Management Area, Faunal Reserve, Zakaznik (Russia), Provincial Reserve, Wildlife Sanctuary</i></p>
              <p><b>V. Protected Landscapes and Seascapes.</b> Protected areas with ecological, biological, or cultural importance that have been shaped by human use of the landscape. Protected landscapes and seascapes typically cover entire bodies of land or ocean and allow for a number of for-profit activities (e.g., ecotourism) in accordance with the region’s management plan.</p>  
              <p><b><i>Other common designations:</b> National Forest, State Natural Area, Environmental Protection Area, Protected Area, Quasi National Park (Japan), Nature Reserve, State Natural Area</i></p>
              <p><b>VI. Protected Areas with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources.</b> Areas designed to manage natural resources and uphold the livelihoods of surrounding communities. These regions have a low level of human occupation, small-scale developments (i.e., not industrial), and part of the landscape in its natural condition.</p>  
              <p><b><i>Other common designations:</b> Wildlife Reserve, Biosphere Reserve, Forest Reserve, Protective Zone, National Forest, Natural and National Reserves, Reserve, Multiple Use Reserve, Municipal Reserve</i></p>
              <p><b>Other Important Designations</b></p>

              <h3>Overview:</h3>
              <p>First defined in 1988 by scientist Norman Myers, biodiversity hotspots are areas characterized by high levels of endemic plants coupled with significant habitat loss. Specifically, a region must meet the following criteria to achieve Conservation International’s hotspot classification:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>	At least 1,500 species of vascular plants (>0.5% of the world’s total) are endemic</li>
                <li>	At least 70% of the original habitat has been lost</li>
              </ul>
              <p>When Myers first defined the term, he identified 10 tropical forest hotspots. The need to pinpoint priority conservation regions led Conservation International (CI) to adopt the term and reassess the hotspot concept. In this process, CI introduced quantitative thresholds (see above) and added additional regions. At that time, there were 25 hotspots. Because of the constant change in environmental threats and the improved understanding of biodiversity, CI has since revisited the hotspots to refine boundaries, update information, and add new regions. This process produced an additional 10 hotspots, bringing the total to 35.</p>
