          <p>Drag the handle to adjust the minimum tree cover canopy (TCC) density for UMD/Google tree cover loss and extent displayed in the graphs and rankings. TCC density represents the estimated percent of a UMD/Google pixel that was covered by tree canopy in the year 2000, as determined from the analysis of satellite imagery. For the tree cover loss data, TCC density therefore corresponds to the density of tree cover <u>before</u> loss occurred.</p>
          <p>Adjustments to the minimum TCC density will only affect UMD/Google tree cover loss and extent. This feature does not pertain to UMD/Google tree cover gain or to other GFW data layers or statistics. UMD/Google tree cover gain is displayed with a set minimum TCC density greater than 50%.</p>
          <p>This feature is also available for the map visualization, analysis, and for individual country profiles. The TCC density minimum selected for the overview graphs and rankings will not be applied automatically to other areas of the website.</p>

        <p>The graph and rankings below were created using tree cover, loss, and gain data from the University of Maryland/Google. For more information on this dataset, please visit the <a href="/sources/forest_change?t=umd_tree_loss_gain" target="_blank"> data page</a>.</p>

        <p>This graph shows global tree cover loss per year in hectares, from 2001 through 2013, with annualized tree cover gain. Tree cover gain is represented as a single horizontal line, indicating the average annual tree cover gain for the period of 2001-2012.</p>

        <p>The rankings below list all countries from greatest to least tree cover loss for the period of 2001-2012. The infographs within the rankings show tree cover loss per year and the dotted line represents annualized tree cover gain 2001-2012.</p>

        <p>This graph shows the percent of tree cover loss per year, relative to 2000 tree cover extent, with annualized percent of tree cover gain for the period of 2001-2012. This graph does not display the rate of tree cover loss, but the percentage of tree cover—as calculated in year 2000—that was lost. Tree cover gain is represented as a single horizontal line, indicating the average percent of tree cover gain for the period of 2001-2012.</p>

        <p>The rankings below list all countries from greatest to least percent tree cover loss, for the period of 2001-2012, relative to 2000 tree cover extent.</p>

        <p>The countries below are ranked by hectares of tree cover extent in year 2000, from greatest to least. Within the rankings, you can also view figures of tree cover loss, for the period of 2001-2013, for comparison.</p>

        <p>This graph plots the ratio of tree cover loss (2001-2013) to gain (2001-2012) against tree cover extent in 2000. Points that fall above the dotted line (ratio = 1) represent countries that have more loss than gain between 2001 and 2012, whereas points that fall below the line represent the opposite -- countries that have more gain than loss within the same time period. The higher the point, the greater the ratio of tree cover loss to gain.</p>

        <p>The horizontal position of the points correlates to the 2000 tree cover extent of the corresponding country. Points that fall far to the right represent countries with greater tree cover extent in 2000, whereas points that fall far to the left represent countries with less tree cover extent.</p>

        <p>The rankings below list all countries from greatest to least ratio of tree cover loss to gain (loss/gain). Large numbers (and all numbers >1) indicate a greater degree of tree cover loss, relative to gain, whereas small numbers (all numbers <1) indicate a greater degree of tree cover gain, relative to loss.</p>

        <p><b>Note:</b>Although the graph and rankings compare tree cover loss and gain, the sum of tree cover loss and gain does not equal “net loss.”</p>
