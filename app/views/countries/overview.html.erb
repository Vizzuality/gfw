        <p>The graph and rankings below were created using tree cover, loss, and gain data from the University of Maryland/Google. For more information on this dataset, please visit the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>.</p>

        <p>This graph shows global tree cover loss per year in hectares, from 2001 through 2012, with annualized tree cover gain. Tree cover gain is represented as a single horizontal line, indicating the average annual tree cover gain for the period of 2001-2012.</p>

        <p>The rankings below list all countries from greatest to least tree cover loss for the period of 2001-2012. The infographs within the rankings show tree cover loss per year and the dotted line represents annualized tree cover gain 2001-2012.</p>

        <p>This graph shows the rate of tree cover loss per year, relative to 2000 tree cover extent, with annualized percent of tree cover gain for the period of 2001-2012. Tree cover gain is represented as a single horizontal line, indicating the average percent of tree cover gain for the period of 2001-2012.</p>

        <p>The rankings below list all countries from greatest to least percent (or rate of) tree cover loss, for the period of 2001-2012, relative to 2000 tree cover extent. The infographs within the rankings show the percent of tree cover loss per year and the dotted line represents the annualized percent of tree cover gain 2001-2012.</p>

        <p>This graph shows the extent of global tree cover and loss per year in hectares from 2001 to 2012. Figures for tree cover extent do not include tree cover gain from 2001-2012.</p>

        <p>The rankings below list all countries from greatest to least tree cover extent, for the period of 2001-2012. The infographs within the rankings show tree cover extent per year (left) and tree cover loss per year (right).

        <p>The graph and rankings below were created using tree cover, loss, and gain data from the University of Maryland/Google. For more information on this dataset, please visit the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>.</p>

        <p>This graph plots the ratio of tree cover loss to gain (loss/gain) for the period of 2001-2012 against tree cover extent in 2012. Points that fall above the dotted line (ratio = 1) represent countries that have more loss than gain between 2001 and 2012, whereas points that fall below the line represent the opposite -- countries that have more gain than loss within the same time period. The higher the point, the greater the ratio of tree cover loss to gain.</p>

        <p>The horizontal position of the points correlates to the 2012 tree cover extent of the corresponding country. Points that fall far to the right represent countries with greater tree cover extent in 2012, whereas points that fall far to the left represent countries with less tree cover extent. </p>

        <p>The rankings below list all countries from greatest to least ratio of tree cover gain to loss (loss/gain), for the period of 2001-2012. Large numbers (and all numbers >1) indicate a greater degree of tree cover loss, relative to gain, whereas small numbers (all numbers <1) indicate a greater degree of tree cover gain, relative to loss.</p>
